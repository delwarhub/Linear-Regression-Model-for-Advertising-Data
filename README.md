Understanding and building a Simple Linear Regression Model

-------------------------------------------------
When we go about knowing Machine Learning models, one of the first things we generally come across is the Simple Linear Regression. It's the first step into Machine Learning.

The term regression was first coined in the 19th century to describe a phenomenon, that the heights of descendants of tall ancestors tend to regress (or approach) towards the normal average height. In other words, regression is the tendency to return to moderation (mean). In statistics, the term is defined as a measure of the relation between an output variable and the input variable(s). Hence, the Linear Regression assumes a linear relationship between the former and the latter. 

Depending upon the number of input variables, Linear Regression can be classified into two categories:
1. Simple Linear Regression (Single Input Variable)
2. Multiple Linear Regression (Multiple Input Variables)
